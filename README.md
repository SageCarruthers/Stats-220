  <h1>Project 1 Repo, Sage Carruthers, Stats 220</h1>
<body>I made this repository to show off what we're doing in <b>Project 1</b> of our <i>Stats 220</i> class. For this project, we have to: 
<ol>
  <li>make a github account and make this very repository</li>
  <li>edit this markdown file to <s>make it look all fancy</s> show we know how to</li>
  <li>make a meme in R and save it as an image</li>
  <li>animate our meme in R and save that as a gif</li> 
  <li>put all our work together in a R markdown file and show we know how to work with Rmd</li>
</ol>

<h2>HTML markdown section</h2>
In this part of the project specifically, we have to: 
 <ul>
  <li>use two different levels of headers</li>
  <li>use ordered and unordered bullet points</li>
  <li>put things in <b>bold</b> and <i>italics</i> or even <b><i>both</i></b> </li>
  <li>include links to other websites, like <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/collections/20-dungeons-and-dragons-memes-to-share-with-your-dnd-group-chat">this one</a> to the site I got inspiration from for my meme or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&feature=youtu.be">this one</a> to my favourite song :) </li>
</ul>

This is my inspiration meme:
